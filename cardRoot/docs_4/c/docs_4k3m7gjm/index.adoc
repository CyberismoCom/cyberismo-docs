== Navigation tree

The left panel of the app displays a hierarchical tree of all cards in the project. Each item in the tree shows:

* An *expand/collapse arrow* for cards that have children
* An optional *coloured status dot* indicating the card's current status
* An optional *error indicator* for cards that include failed policy checks
* The *card title*
* An optional *progress indicator* (e.g. "75%") for cards that track completion

Click a card in the tree to view it in the right panel. Click the arrow or double-click to expand or collapse a branch.

The project name appears as a clickable heading above the tree. Clicking it navigates to the project root.

== Searching for cards

A *search input* is located at the top of the navigation tree. As you type, the tree filters in real time:

* Matching is *case-insensitive* and based on the card title
* If a card matches the search query, it and all its ancestors are shown
* If a descendant matches, all cards in the path from root to that descendant are preserved
* Matching branches are *automatically expanded*

Press *Escape* or click the *X* button to clear the search and restore the full tree.

== Breadcrumbs

Above the card content, a *breadcrumb trail* shows the path from the project root to the currently viewed card. Each breadcrumb is clickable, allowing you to quickly navigate to any ancestor card. A home icon represents the project root.

== Resizing the navigation panel

The left panel can be resized by dragging the divider between the navigation tree and the content area.
