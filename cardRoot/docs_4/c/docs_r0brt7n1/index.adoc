The `report` macro shows the a report based on the results of a query. 

To see a list of the available reports, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo show reports

For example, the report `base/reports/childrenList` shows a list of child cards. To use this report, use the following syntax:

``{&#847;{&#847;{ report '{`` +
``&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;&#12288;"name": "base/reports/childrenList"`` +
``}' }&#847;}&#847;}``
