The `report` macro shows the a report based on the results of a query. 

To see a list of the available reports, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo show reports

For example, the report `base/reports/childrenList` shows a list of child cards. To use this report, use the following syntax:

++++
{{#raw}}
<pre><code>
{{#report}}

    "name": "base/reports/childrenList"
{{/report}}
</code></pre>
{{/raw}}
++++
