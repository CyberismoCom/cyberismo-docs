You can create new cards in your Cyberismo project by clicking **CREATE NEW CARD** at the top right of the app. The app will show a dialog for selecting a template from which the new card or cards will be created.

The `createCards` macro provides another way to create content: the macro produces a button for creating new cards from a certain template.

To see a list of the available templates, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo show templates

You can see some details of a template, such as `base/templates/page`, with the following command:

  $ cyberismo show template base/templates/page

For example, to produce a button that creates a new card from the template `base/templates/page', the ``createCards`` macro has the following syntax:
```
{{#raw}}

{{#createCards}}

    "template": "base/templates/page",
    "buttonLabel": "Create a new page"
{{/createCards}}

{{/raw}}
```

In the app, this macro will produce a button to create a new page as a child card of the page where the macro was used.

{{#createCards}}
    "template": "base/templates/page",
    "buttonLabel": "Create a new page"
{{/createCards}}

NOTE: When you export content as a documentation site or in some other format, the ``createCards`` macro will not produce anything. Take this into account when writing any instructions along with this macro.
