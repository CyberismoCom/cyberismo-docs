Cyberismo extends the AsciiDoc notation with macros.

Macros are defined using the following notation:footnote:[The macro notation is based on the https://handlebarsjs.com/guide/#custom-helpers[Handlebars block helper notation]]

```
{{#raw}}

{{#macroName}}
  "parameter1": "value",
  "parameter2": "value"
{{/macroName}}

{{/raw}}
```

The parameters of the macro are enclosed within a leading macro "mustache", identified by the `#` character and the name of the macro, and a closing mustache of the same name but starting with the `/` character. The macro parameters are a JSON object, only without the enclosing `{` and `}` characters, as the macro mustaches already enclose the parameters.

== Available macros

You can use the following macros in the AsciiDoc contents of cards. It is also possible to use macros in report templates, which will yield nested macros.

{{#report}}
  "name": "base/reports/childrenList"
{{/report}}
