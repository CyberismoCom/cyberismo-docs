The `image` macro includes an image from a card attachment in the card content.

NOTE: We recommend using the Cyberismo `image` macro instead of https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[AsciiDoc's built-in image macro], as there are some limitations in Cyberismo's support for the AsciiDoc native image macro.

== Parameters

* `"fileName"`: The filename of the image attachment to include
* `"cardKey"`: The key of the card containing the image attachment. Optional, if not specified, uses the current card
* `"alt"`: Alternative text for the image (optional)
* `"title"`: Title attribute for the image (optional)

== Example

Consider the following `image` macro:

```
{{#raw}}

{{#image}}
  "fileName": "cyberismo-architecture-website.svg",
  "cardKey": "docs_11"
{{/image}}

{{/raw}}
```

This macro will include an image from {{#xref}}"cardKey": "docs_11"{{/xref}} as follows:

{{#image}}
  "fileName": "cyberismo-architecture-website.svg",
  "cardKey": "docs_11"
{{/image}}
