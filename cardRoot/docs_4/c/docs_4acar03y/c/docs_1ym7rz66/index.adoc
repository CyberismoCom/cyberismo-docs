The `xref` macro adds a reference to another card, which is given in the `"cardKey"` parameter.

NOTE: Cyberismo has partial support for https://docs.asciidoctor.org/pdf-converter/latest/interdocument-xrefs/[AsciiDoc's built-in xref macro], but as there are some limitations, we recommend using the Cyberismo `xref` macro instead.

== Example

Consider this following AsciiDoc snippet:

```
{{#raw}}

To give us feedback, see {{#xref}} "cardKey": "docs_i13qzif0" {{/xref}}.

{{/raw}}
```

This will be rendered as:

To give us feedback, see {{#xref}} "cardKey": "docs_i13qzif0" {{/xref}}.
