You can create new cards in your Cyberismo project by clicking **Create** at the top right of the app. The app will show a dialog for selecting a template from which the new card or cards will be created.

The `createCards` macro provides another way to create content: the macro produces a button for creating new cards from a certain template.

== Available templates

To see a list of the available templates, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo show templates

You can see some details of a template, such as `base/templates/page`, with the following command:

  $ cyberismo show template base/templates/page

To learn how to create new templates, please see xref:docs_7n7gqu93.adoc[Templates].

== Basic `createCards` macro

For example, to produce a button that creates a new card from the template `base/templates/page', the ``createCards`` macro has the following syntax:
```
{{#raw}}

{{#createCards}}
    "template": "base/templates/page",
    "buttonLabel": "Create a new page"
{{/createCards}}

{{/raw}}
```

In the app, this macro will produce a button to create a new page as a child card of the page where the macro was used.

{{#createCards}}
    "template": "base/templates/page",
    "buttonLabel": "Create a new page"
{{/createCards}}

NOTE: When you export content as a documentation site or in some other format, the ``createCards`` macro will not produce anything. Take this into account when writing any instructions along with this macro.

== Creating a link to the newly created card

Sometimes it is useful to link the newly created cards automatically to an existing card. The `createCards` macro supports this with an optional `link` parameter.

NOTE: This form of the `createCards` macro is especially useful when `createCards` is used as a part of the output of a report. This makes it possible to calculate the card key of the parent of the new cards and the card key of the end point of the link with a query. For example, you can have a button to create a risk on an asset card. The risk will be created under a risk register card, but it will be linked to the asset, under which the user clicked the button to create the risk. 

To create a link to the newly created card(s), include a link object in the parameters of the `createCards` macro. If a link object is included in the macro, then a link is created between the given card key of the link object and all top-level new cards. Usually, this feature is used with templates that include just one top-level card, but if there are many top-level cards, then the macro will link all of them.

The full syntax of the `createCards` macro is as follows.

```
{{#raw}}


{{#createCards}}
  "template": <the name of the template>,
  "buttonLabel": <the label on the button>,
  "cardKey": <the card under which the new card(s) will be created>,
  "link": {
    "linkType": <the name of the link type that will be created>,
    "direction": <"inbound" or "outbound" from the point of view of the new card(s)>,
    "cardKey": <the source of an inbound link or the destination of an outbound link>
  }
{{/createCards}}

{{/raw}}
```

The parameters for the `createCards` macro must meet these criteria: 

* `link` object is optional
* If a link object is included, then it must include `linkType`, `direction` and `cardKey`
* The `linkType` must exist
* `direction` must be `inbound` or `outbound`
* The `cardKey` of the link object must exist

If validation fails, then the macro will result in a macro error admonition that explains what the problem is.

The link(s) are created after the new card(s) have been successfully created. Even if creating the link(s) fails for any reason, the cards will not be removed.
