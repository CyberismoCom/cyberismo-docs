To see a list of the available reports, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo show reports

== Parameters

The `report` macro supports the following parameters:

* `"name"`: The name of the report (required).
* `"cardKey"`: The card to use as context for the report (optional). If not specified, the card containing this macro is used as context.

Reports may define additional report-specific parameters.

{{/report}}

{{/raw}}

```
