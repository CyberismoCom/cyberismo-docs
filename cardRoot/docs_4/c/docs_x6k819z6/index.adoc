== Entering edit mode

To edit a card, click the *Edit* button in the card toolbar, or press *E*. The card view switches to the editor.

== The editor layout

The editor has two tabs:

* *Edit* — where you write and modify content
* *Preview* — shows a live rendered preview of the card as it will appear

The Edit tab is split into two panes:

* *Left pane* — the title field, metadata fields, and AsciiDoc source editor
* *Right pane* — the attachments panel

== Editing the title and metadata

At the top of the editor, a *title field* lets you change the card's title directly.

Below it, an expandable *metadata section* shows all editable fields for the card. The available fields depend on the card type and may include text fields, dates, enumerations, and person fields.

== The AsciiDoc editor

The main editor area is a *CodeMirror-based source editor* with syntax highlighting and line wrapping. You write card content using https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc notation].

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language primarily designed for writing technical documentation. It has a rich notation that supports, for example, headings, tables, lists, admonitions, footnotes, and links. Cyberismo extends the AsciiDoc notation with macros; see xref:docs_4acar03y.adoc[Macros].

Above the editor, a *formatting toolbar* provides quick access to common operations:

== Managing attachments

The attachments panel on the right side of the editor shows all files attached to the card. From here you can:

* *Add an attachment* — click the "Add attachment" button and select a file
* *Delete an attachment* — hover over an attachment and click the delete icon
* *Download an attachment* — hover and click the download icon
* *Insert into content* — hover and click the insert icon to add an AsciiDoc reference to the attachment at the cursor position
* *Drag and drop* — drag an attachment from the panel into the editor to insert a reference

Image attachments display a thumbnail preview; other file types show a file icon.

You can also add attachments via the card toolbar's context menu (⋯ → *Add attachment*).

== Saving and cancelling

* Click *Update* to save your changes. The button is disabled until you make a change.
* Click *Cancel* or press *Escape* to discard changes and return to view mode.

== Moving a card

You can move a card to a different position in the hierarchy:

. Click the *context menu* (⋯) in the card toolbar
. Select *Move card*
. In the dialog, search for or browse to the target parent card
. Confirm the move

You can also *drag and drop* cards directly in the navigation tree to reorder or reparent them.

== Deleting a card

To delete a card, click the context menu (⋯) in the card toolbar and select *Delete card*. A confirmation dialog appears before the card is removed.
