The content of the cards uses the AsciiDoc syntax. 

== AsciiDoc syntax

AsciiDoc is a lightweight markup language primarily designed for writing technical documentation. It has a rich syntax that supports, for example headings, tables, lists, admonitions, footnotes, and links. 

For a reference guide to the AsciiDoc syntax, see https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/syntax-quick-reference/[AsciiDoc Quick Reference].

== Attachments

Cyberismo cards may include images and other file attachments. To show an attachment image, for example ``filename.png``, inline with the content, use the following syntax:

  image::filename.png[]
