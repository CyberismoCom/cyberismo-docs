The Cyberismo app is a local web application for viewing and editing the contents of a Cyberismo project. It runs in a web browser at http://localhost:3000/.

== Starting the app

To start the app, execute the following command in the Cyberismo project directory:

[source,console]
----
$ cyberismo app
----

Then open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

CAUTION: The Cyberismo app has been designed for local use by a single user only. Do not expose this web application over the network or to multiple users.

== App layout

The app uses a two-column layout:

* The *left panel* contains a searchable navigation tree for browsing cards. The panel is resizable.
* The *right panel* displays the selected card's content, metadata, and related information.

Above the content area, a *toolbar* provides contextual actions for the selected card.

At the very top, the *application bar* shows the Cyberismo logo, a theme toggle (system / light / dark), and a "New Card" button.

== Viewing a card

When you select a card from the navigation tree, the right panel shows:

* *Card title* — displayed as a heading at the top
* *Metadata section* — a collapsible panel showing the card key, card type, last updated date, labels, and custom fields. Some fields are always visible; others can be revealed with a "Show more" toggle.
* *Linked cards section* — a collapsible accordion showing all links to and from the card, with link type, target card, and optional description
* *Rendered content* — the card's AsciiDoc content, rendered as formatted HTML with support for macros
* *Sidebar* — on the right side, showing a table of contents (auto-generated from headings), notifications, and policy check results

== Workflow transitions

The card toolbar shows the current workflow state as a coloured dropdown button. Clicking it reveals the available transitions from the current state. Selecting a transition changes the card's state immediately.

== Creating new cards

Click the *"New Card"* button in the application bar or press *C* to open the card creation dialog. Templates are displayed as visual cards organised by category. Select a template and click *Create*. The new card is created as a child of the currently selected card.
