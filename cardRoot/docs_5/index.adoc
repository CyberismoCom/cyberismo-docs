Not all users are able to install the Cyberismo tools or keep an up to date version of the content on their computers. Sometimes you just want to see the latest versions of the cybersecurity documentation with just a browser. The Cyberismo tool enables this with its static documentation site export functionality.

You can export a Cyberismo project as a static documentation site by entering the following command in the Cyberismo project directory:

[source,console]
----
$ cyberismo export site /path/to/target/directory
----

When complete, the script will output:
[source,console]
----
Site generation complete!
Open file:///tmp/site/index.html in a browser to view your site.
Done
----

CAUTION:  If you host the static documentation site for your users, then it is your responsibility to ensure that access to the documentation site is appropriately controlled.
