== Description

A policy check has failed on a card. Use this version of `policyCheckFailure`, if the check is not related to a particular field of the card.

== Example

The logic program of this documentation project includes the following fact, which produces the failed policy check that you can see on this page on the right. In real use, `policyCheckFailure` would not be used in a fact, but they would be used in the heads of rules to produce a policy check failure, if certain conditions are met.
