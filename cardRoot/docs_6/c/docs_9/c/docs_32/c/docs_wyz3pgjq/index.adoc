== Parameters

* `CardKey`: The card key of the card that is associated with a failing policy check
* `Category`: The category of the policy check, a string identifier for organising policy checks
* `Title`: The title of the policy check, a string identifier for organising policy checks
* `Message`: A message that explains the failed policy check
* `Field`: The name of the field that this check is related to.

== Description

A policy check has failed on a card. Use this version of `policyCheckFailure`, if the check is related to a particular field of the card. When the policy check failure is shown in the user interface, it will include a link to go to the field. If the user clicks the link, Cyberismo will put the card in edit mode and put the field on focus.

== Example

The logic program of this documentation project includes the following fact, which produces the failed policy check that you can see on this page on the right. In real use, `policyCheckFailure` would not be used in a fact, but they would be used in the heads of rules to produce a successful policy check, if certain conditions are met.

To test the *Go to field* feature, you can clone this documentation project and run it on your own computer.
