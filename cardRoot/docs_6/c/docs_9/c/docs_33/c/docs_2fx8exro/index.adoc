== Description

The `fields` predicate is a helper that enables a single rule in a query to define values for three (or two) fields.

This predicate has been implemented with the following rules:

----
field(Key, Field, Value) :-
    fields(Key, Field, Value, _, _, _, _).

field(Key, Field, Value) :-
    fields(Key, _, _, Field, Value, _, _).
    
field(Key, Field, Value) :-
    fields(Key, _, _, _, _, Field, Value).
