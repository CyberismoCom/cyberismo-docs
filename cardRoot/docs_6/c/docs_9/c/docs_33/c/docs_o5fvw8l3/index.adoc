== Parameters

* `Collection`: The name of the child result collection or child object for which the field should be included
* `Field`: The name of the field that should be included in the query results

== Description

The `selectCollectionField(Collection, Field)` predicate is used to select a specific field for a named collection across all levels of hierarchy in query results. This is useful when you have custom collections (not the default `"results"` collection) and want to include specific fields from those collections without having to specify the hierarchy level explicitly.

This predicate is particularly helpful when working with hierarchical queries that use named collections via `childResult(Key, Child, Collection)` or `childObject(Key, Child, Collection)`.

For example, if your query produces child results in a collection called `"items"`, you can use:

[source]
----
selectCollectionField("items", "title").
selectCollectionField("items", "status").
----

This will ensure that the `title` and `status` fields are included for all results in the `"items"` collection, regardless of which hierarchy level they appear on.
