Notifications enable logic programs to communicate messages to the user based on the state of the fields and the relationships of the cards. Unlike xref:docs_32.adoc[automated policy checks], notifications do not communicate failure or success. Use notifications to give advice or helpful tips. 

Notifications can be defined in user-configured logic programs with the term

[source]
----
notification( <card key>, <test suite>, <test case>, <message> )
----

The arguments test suite and test case are string identifiers for organising the checks that yield notifications.
