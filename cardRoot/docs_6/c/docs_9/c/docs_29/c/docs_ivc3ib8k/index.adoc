== Parameters

* `Source`: The card key of the source of the link
* `Destination`: The card key of the destination of the link
* `LinkType`: The name of the link type
* `LinkDescription`: A string that describes the link

== Description

The `link` predicate declares a link between cards. Use this variant of the link predicate, if the link type uses link descriptions.

Cyberismo generates `link` facts for user-defined links. Logic programs can use `link` in the heads of rules to define calculated links, although calculated links are typically not used with link types that require link descriptions.
