User programs can define _calculated fields_. A calculated field is implemented using the same `field` term that is used when generating the logic program from the Cyberismo content. It is as simple as that!

This is best explained with an example. Let us assume that a card type risk has two integer fields `likelihood` and `impact`, which range between 1..3. The following logic program adds a calculated field `riskLevel`, ranging between 1..9, calculated with the formula `likelihood * impact`, to all cards of the card type risk that have the fields `likelihood` and `impact`.

field(X, "moduleName/fieldTypes/riskLevel", Likelihood * Impact) :-
    field(X, "cardType", "moduleName/cardTypes/risk"),
    field(X, "moduleName/fieldTypes/likelihood", Likelihood),
    field(X, "moduleName/fieldTypes/impact", Impact).
