== Parameters

* `CardKey`: The card key of the card, whose workflow state transition shall have a side effect
* `Transition`: The name of a workflow transition
* `AffectedCard`: The card key of the card, whose field will be set
* `Field`: The name of the field that will be set
* `NewValue`: The new value of the field 

== Description

If `onTransitionSetField(CardKey, Transition, AffectedCard, Field, NewValue)` is true, and if the workflow transition `Transition` is executed on `CardKey`, then the field `Field` of `AffectedCard` shall be set to `NewValue`.

Notice that creating a card is also a workflow transition. This enables logic programs to define side effects upon creating a new card. For example, the title of the new card can be set by the logic program.
