This page describes the naming conventions when developing new Cyberismo solution modules. While you are free to use

== General principle: use camelCase

In general, the user-configurable names in Cyberismo content format use the so called `camelCase` notation, except labels, which use the so-called `kebab-case`.

Cyberismo _modules_ have a separately configurable name, which is defined in the `cardsConfig.json` file by convention in `camelCase`. Similarly by convention, the source code repository of a module is named in kebab-case and it should begin with `module-`, for example `module-my-example`.

Other types of Cyberismo configuration do not have separately configurable names, but their name is the file or directory name in which they are declared. Card types, workflows, field types, link types, templates and other basic concepts of the Cyberismo content format are named in `camelCase`. For example, a `securityIssue` card type would be defined in a JSON file `securityIssue.json`

All other types of files in the Cyberismo content format are also named in `camelCase`. This includes logic program file names that have the file extension `.lp`, such as `riskLevelCalculation.lp`.

CAUTION: Do not choose names that differ in their case only, such as `example.json` and `Example.json`, because they may be confused as the same file in case-insensitive file systems.

== References to configuration

When we refer to these concepts in the configuration, the references always include the module name and the type of the concept, for example `myModule/templates/decision`

Do not include the type of the item in the name. For example, if you need a workflow for decisions, it should be called `decision` rather than `decisionWorkflow`. It will be referred to as `moduleName/workflows/decision`.

The following table shows how the main Cyberismo concepts are referred to in Cyberismo modules.

|Concept  |Example Name

|Workflow
|`module1/workflows/example`
|Card type
|`module1/cardTypes/example`
|Field type
|`module1/fieldTypes/example`
|Link type
|`module1/linkTypes/example`
|Template
|`module1/templates/example`

== Naming in logic programs

Naming of terms in logic programs follows the same `camelCase` convention as other naming in the Cyberismo solution. As required by the syntax rules of Answer Set Programming, the names of atoms and constants begin with a lowercase character, and variable names begin with an uppercase character.

NOTE: If a Cyberismo content module needs to define a new global name, such as a new constant or a new complex term, the name should include the module name as a prefix.

== Names of Cyberismo concepts in `field` terms

User-configured field types and built-in fields of cards are used in `field` terms of logic programs. Consistently with other cases where configuration is referred to, these names are in `camelCase`.

|`lastTransitioned`
|Title

|Workflow state
|`workflowState`
|User-configured field
|`moduleName/fieldTypes/example`

== Labels

Labels should be used sparingly. Consider using a custom field instead of a label, whenever possible. Labels should be named according to the `kebab-case` convention.
