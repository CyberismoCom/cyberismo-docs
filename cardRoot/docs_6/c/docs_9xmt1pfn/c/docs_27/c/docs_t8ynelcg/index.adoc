== Parameters

* `CardType`: the name of a card type
* `FieldType`: the name of a field type

== Description

`FieldType` is a calculated field in the cards of the type `CardType`, so the user interface will not allow the user to set them.

There should be a logic program in the `calculations` folder of the project or of one of the modules, or otherwise this field will not have any value.

Cyberismo will generate the `customField` fact for calculated fields, too.
