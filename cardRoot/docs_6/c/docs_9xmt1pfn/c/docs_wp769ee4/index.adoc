== Introduction

The configuration of a graph consists of a graph model and a graph view, allowing several different graph views to be created based on a single graph model. 

Please see xref:docs_hbskjelr.adoc[Implementing graphs] for a longer introduction to graphs.

== Managing graph models using the Cyberismo command line tool

To see a list of the available graph models, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo show graphModels

To see the help for how to create a graph model, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo create graphModel --help

To create a new graph model, for example `myGraphModel`, use the following command:

  $ cyberismo create graphModel myGraphModel

Cyberismo will create the following files:

* Graph model metadata file `.cards/local/graphModels/myGraphModel.json`
* Directory `.cards/local/graphModels/myGraphModel/`
* Model file `.cards/local/graphModels/myGraphModel/model.lp`

If the card prefix of your Cyberismo project is `example`, then the full name of the new graph model will be `example/graphModels/myGraphModel`.

When choosing a name for your graph models, see xref:docs_8.adoc[Naming conventions].

To finalise the graph model definition, you need to use a text editor to 

* Edit the basic graph model metadata in the `.cards/local/graphModels/myGraphModel.json` file 
* Edit the model implementation in `.cards/local/graphModels/myGraphModel/model.lp`

== Graph model JSON file format

Basic metadata for a graph model is defined in a JSON file that follows the https://github.com/CyberismoCom/cyberismo/blob/main/tools/assets/src/schema/resources/graphModelSchema.json[graph model schema], as described in the following table.

.The properties of a graph model JSON file
|===
|Properties|Type|Description|Required

|**name**
|`string`
|The technical name of the graph model
| &#10003; Yes

|**displayName**
|`string`
|The name of the graph model as it should be displayed in the user interface. For example, 'Workflow'.
| &#10003; Yes

|**description**
|`string`
|A description of the graph model. For example, "A model for a diagram of the state machine of a workflow".
| No

|**category**
|`string`
| The category of the graph model. For example, 'General'.
| &#10003; Yes

|===

Additional properties are not allowed.

== Graph model implementation

The graph model implementation is a logic program that uses the Clingraph conventions to describe a graph. When the graph model is executed, it is combined with a graph view and the main Cyberismo logic program, so you can write rules that convert your data into nodes and edges of a graph.

The implementation of graphs is discussed in detail in xref:docs_hbskjelr.adoc[Implementing graphs].

== Mapping to a logic program

Cyberismo does not currently generate logic program facts for graph models.
