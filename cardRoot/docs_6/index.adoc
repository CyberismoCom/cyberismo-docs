A Cyberismo module is a reusable collection of templates, card types, workflows, field types, link types, reports and logic program calculations. When a user imports a module as a dependency to their Cyberismo project, a read-only copy of the module is included in the project directory structure.

The most common module is the base module, which defines some commonly used basic card types and their workflows.

Technically, a module is a Cyberismo project just like any other project, but it is just intended to be reused in other projects.

To develop a new Cyberismo module, follow these steps:

. Create a new Cyberismo project. See xref:docs_7.adoc[Creating a new project] tutorial for more information
. Import the base module. Avoid defining redudant configurations to the base module in your new module, unless necessary. This is also explained in the xref:docs_7.adoc[Creating a new project] tutorial.
. If you need new workflows, then create them first. Notice that you can use the workflows from the base module, if they apply to your use case.
. If you need new types of custom fields, then create and design field types.
. If you need new card types, then create and design card types. A card type selects one of the available workflows and a set of custom fields.
. Design any new templates.
. Develop any new module-specific logic programs
. Design any new reports
