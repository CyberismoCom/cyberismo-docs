== Introduction

This tutorial shows how to get started with the Cyberismo dataflow module. The Cyberismo dataflow module defines card types and link types for creating dataflow models with processes, external entities, data storages, trust boundaries and data flows. This enables you to model your software systems using cards and links in Cyberismo. 

The Cyberismo dataflow module uses graph macros that translate the model into graphical views. You can generate different views from the same data. For example, a high-level context diagram for an internet banking systemfootnote:[This example is based on an example from https://c4model.com[C4 model].] could look like this:

If you draw a diagram that includes all the details of the model, you could get an image like this:

== Prerequisites

xref:docs_13.adoc[Install Cyberismo].

== Clone the Cyberismo dataflow module

Execute the following command to clone the Cyberismo dataflow module:

[source,console]
----
$ git clone git@github.com:CyberismoCom/module-dataflow.git
----

== Create a project

Create a new project called, for example, "Dataflow tutorial" that has the card key prefix `dftutorial` in the directory `dataflow-tutorial` with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ cyberismo create project "Dataflow tutorial" dftutorial dataflow-tutorial
----

NOTE: Do not use the module prefix `dataflow` for the new project, because `dataflow` is already in use by the Cyberismo dataflow module.

== Import the dataflow module to your new project

Import the Cyberismo dataflow module to your new project with the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ cyberismo import module module-dataflow -p dataflow-tutorial
----

== Start the Cyberismo app

To start using the Cyberismo dataflow module, we need to start the Cyberismo app. First, change to the `dataflow-tutorial` directory:

[source,console]
----
$ cd dataflow-tutorial
----


To start the app, execute the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ cyberismo app
----

Then open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/.

== Create a dataflow model

Click *Create* at the top right:

image::create-new.card.png[]

Select the dataflow model template and click *Create*:

image::create-dataflow-model.png[]

You will get a new card titled *Untitled dataflow model*:

image::untitled-dataflow.model.png[]

Click *Edit* and rename the dataflow model as *My web application*

== Add entities and trust boundaries

Create a person called *User*, a trust boundary called *Backend trust boundary* and a process called *Web front end* at the top level. Under the trust boundary, create a process *Web backend* and a Datastore *Database*. You can enter descriptions and technologies, which will be used in the diagrams. Each card will show a graph that illustrates the entity, and the top level dataflow model shows a context view and a detailed view:

== Add data flows

Dataflows are entered as links between cards. To add a link, click the link icon at the top of the view:

image::link-1.png[]

Fill in the details of the dataflow:

. Select *dataflow to* or *dataflow from* as the link type
. Select the other end of the dataflow
. Write a short description of the dataflow
. Click *Add link*

== Top-level diagrams

After adding dataflows between cards, the top-level dataflow model could look as follows:
