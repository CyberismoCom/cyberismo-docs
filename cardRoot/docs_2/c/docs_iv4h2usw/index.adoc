After launching the the Cyberismo app, use the table of contents on the left hand side to navigate to the card (page) you created on the command line.

Click the *Edit* button in the top right hand corner of the browser window. The card editor opens:

The card editor uses the https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] syntax. AsciiDoc is very similar to the more commonly known MarkDown, but AsciiDoc is more feature rich and better suited for more complex content.

Covering the AsciiDoc language features is beyond the scope of this tutorial. The https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/[AsciiDoc documentation] contains the entire language specification, with helpful examples.

Once you are happy with the card content, click the *Update* button to save your changes to the local filesystem.
