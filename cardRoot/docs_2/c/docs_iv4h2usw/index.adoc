After launching the the Cyberismo app, use the table of contents on the left hand side to navigate to the card (page) you created on the command line.

Click the *Edit* button in the top right hand corner of the browser window. The card editor opens:

The card editor uses the https://asciidoc.org/[AsciiDoc] syntax. AsciiDoc is very similar to the more commonly known MarkDown, but AsciiDoc is more feature rich and better suited for more complex content. For more information, see xref:docs_x6k819z6.adoc[Authoring card content].

Once you are happy with the card content, click the *Update* button to save your changes to the local filesystem.
