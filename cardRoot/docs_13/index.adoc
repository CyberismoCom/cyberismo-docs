This section covers how to install, update, and uninstall the Cyberismo tool. Several installation methods are available to suit different environments and preferences:

* *NPM registry* — the recommended method for most users. Install the Cyberismo CLI directly from the public NPM registry.
* *Docker or Podman* — run Cyberismo as a container without installing dependencies on your host system.
* *Build from source* — clone the repository and build locally on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

Before installing, ensure you have https://git-scm.com/[Git] installed, as it is needed to manage Cyberismo content and modules.
