== Docker image from Docker Hub

For macOS and Linux, this is probably the easiest way to try out Cyberismo. For Windows, building the application locally from source is the recommended way, and it is not half as frightening as it sounds.

=== Prerequisites

The system must have Docker or a similar container environment installed, capable of running Linux-based images. The simplest way to install a container environment is to install https://www.docker.com[Docker Desktop].

=== Downloading image from Docker Hub
The latest image can be downloaded with the following command:

  $ docker pull cyberismo/cyberismo

=== Running

For *Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)* the volume mount needs :Z or :z option, like "-v .:/project:z" to allow working mounting

It is recommended to execute the following commands only within the Cyberismo root directory or within project directories.

To simplify running the image, you can use the following command (works only on Unix-based systems, not in Windows CMD or PowerShell):

  $ alias cyberismo="docker run --rm -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v .:/project -p 3000:3000 cyberismo/cyberismo cyberismo"

.Explanation of alias
[%collapsible]
====
The alias command allows you to execute the configured Docker environment with a single, simple command.

Flags in command:

* -rm: Removes the container automatically after it exits.
* -it: Runs the container in interactive mode.
* --user: Container user will use the same user id as the user executing the command. This will prevent file ownership problems.
* -v: Maps the current execution directory to the /project directory inside the container, sharing files between host and container.
* -p: Forwards the port from the container to the host machine, enabling access to the hosted web service.
