== Docker image from Docker Hub

=== Prerequisites

Install Git. While Cyberismo does not directly depend on Git, you will need it to manage Cyberismo content, such as when installing Cyberismo modules. Git installation guide: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

The system must have Docker or a similar container environment installed, capable of running Linux-based images. The simplest way to install a container environment is to install https://www.docker.com[Docker Desktop].

=== Downloading image from Docker Hub
The latest image can be downloaded with the following command:

  $ docker pull cyberismo/cyberismo

=== Running

*Linux & macOS*

To simplify running the image, you can use the following alias:

  $ alias cyberismo='docker run --init --rm -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -e HOME=/tmp -v $(pwd):/project:Z -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 cyberismo/cyberismo:latest cyberismo'

.Explanation of alias
[%collapsible]
====
The alias command allows you to execute the configured Docker environment with a single command.

Flags in command:

* `--init` ensures proper signal handling and zombie process reaping in the container.
* `--rm` removes the container automatically after it exits.
* `-it` runs the container in interactive mode.
* `--user` sets the container user to the same user ID as the user executing the command, preventing file ownership problems.
* `-e HOME=/tmp` sets the HOME environment variable so tools like Antora can write to user-specific directories without permission errors.
* `-v` maps the current execution directory to the /project directory inside the container, sharing files between host and container.
* To support *Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux)*, the volume mount includes the `:Z` option and uses an absolute path to the present working directory (`-v $(pwd):/project:Z`).
* `-p` forwards the port from the container to the host machine, enabling access to the hosted web service.
====

Afterward, you can run the application using the following command:

  $ cyberismo --help

*Windows*

The Windows environment does not support aliases like Linux and macOS do, so the command to use Docker is:

  $ docker run --rm -it --user $(id -u):$(id -g) -v .:/project -p 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 cyberismo/cyberismo cyberismo --help
