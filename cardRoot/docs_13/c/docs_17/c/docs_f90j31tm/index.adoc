== Building and running Cyberismo locally from source

=== Prerequisites

Install Git. While Cyberismo does not directly depend on Git, you will need it to manage Cyberismo content, such as when installing Cyberismo modules. Git installation guide: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git

Install Node.js. The currently supported Node.js version is the latest LTS, v20.10.0 or later. Node.js is downloadable from https://nodejs.org/.

When building Cyberismo on macOS, a utility script installs Miniconda and the required dependencies into the `vendor` directory in the Cyberismo main directory. Instructions are provided below.

=== Building

Take the following steps:

. Clone the source repository:

  $ git clone https://github.com/CyberismoCom/cyberismo.git

. Change to the source directory. If you previously cloned the repository, pull the latest changes:

  $ cd cyberismo
  $ git pull origin main # Optional

. Install pnpm with npm command:

  $ npm install -g pnpm

. Execute the following commands:

  $ pnpm setup
  $ pnpm install
  $ pnpm build
  $ pnpm link -g

. On macOS, install the dependencies (Clingo and Clingraph) with:

  $ pnpm install-dev-packages

=== Running

After building and installing, run `cyberismo --help` to see the command-line help.
