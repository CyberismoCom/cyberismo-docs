== Definition of Done

* All new code has been thoroughly tested via unit, BAT, and cypress tests
* New and existing tests still pass
* Documentation has been updated, or at least a PR or JIRA ticket has been created for the documentation change
* New code follows coding style^1^ and is understandable
* New implementation works in Linux, Mac and Windows
* Pull Request completed and passed
* Acceptance criteria in JIRA ticket met
* Non-functional requirements have been considered
    ** Performance
    ** Maintainability
    ** Installation

^1^ We don’t have coding style documentation at the moment. For now, this means that the new code looks similar to existing code.

=== Special cases

==== Adding new node module dependencies

* New modules should be checked to be still in use by the community
* New module should not have open critical vulnerabilities
* License of the new module has been checked

==== Adding new (non-node module) dependencies

* Architecture images and documentation has been updated
* Installation is possible to all supported platforms (Linux, Mac, Windows)
* Module has been considered to be strictly necessary
* CI/CD has been updated so that cyberismo and cyberismo-docs builds succeed

==== Adding new resource types to cyberismo application

* Add support for “create”, “show”, “remove” operations in the CLI
* New resource type need to be supported in calculations, if feasible
* New source type need to be supported in “rename” operations
