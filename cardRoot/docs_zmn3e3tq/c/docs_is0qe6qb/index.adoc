== Definition of Done

* All new code has been thoroughly tested via unit, BAT, and Cypress tests.
* New and existing tests still pass.
* Documentation has been updated, or at least a PR or JIRA ticket has been created for the documentation change.
* New code follows the coding style^1^ and is understandable.
* New implementation works in Linux, Mac, and Windows.
* Pull Request completed and passed.
* Acceptance criteria in JIRA ticket met.
* Non-functional requirements have been considered:
    ** Performance
    ** Maintainability
    ** Installation

^1^ We do not have coding style documentation at the moment. For now, this means that new code looks similar to existing code.

=== Special cases

==== Adding new node module dependencies

* New modules should be checked to be still in use by the community.
* New module should not have open critical vulnerabilities.
* Licence of the new module has been checked.

==== Adding new (non-node module) dependencies

* Architecture images and documentation have been updated.
* Installation is possible on all supported platforms (Linux, Mac, and Windows).
* Module has been considered to be strictly necessary.
* CI/CD has been updated so that cyberismo and cyberismo-docs builds succeed.

==== Adding new resource types to the Cyberismo application

* Add support for "create", "show", and "remove" operations in the CLI.
* New resource type needs to be supported in calculations, if feasible.
* New resource type needs to be supported in "rename" operations.
