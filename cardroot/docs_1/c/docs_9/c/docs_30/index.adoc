User programs can define _calculated fields_. A calculated field is implemented using the same `field` predicate that is used when generating the logic program from the Cyberismo content. It is as simple as that!

This is best explained with an example. Let us assume that a card type risk has two integer fields `likelihood` and `impact`, which range between 1..3. The following logic program adds a calculated field `riskLevel`, ranging between 1..9, calculated with the formula `likelihood * impact`, to all cards of the card type risk that have the fields `likelihood` and `impact`.

field(X, "riskLevel", Likelihood * Impact / 3) :-
    field(X, "cardtype", "risk"),
    field(X, "likelihood", Likelihood),
    field(X, "impact", Impact).
