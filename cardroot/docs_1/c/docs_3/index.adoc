== Building and running Cyberismo from source

=== Prerequisites

. Install Git. While Cyberismo does not directly depend on Git, you will need it to manage Cyberismo content, such as when installing Cyberismo modules.

. Install Clingo. The currently supported Clingo version is 5.7.1. We recommend installing a Python-enabled build using Anaconda, as instructed in https://github.com/potassco/clingo/releases/.

. Install Node.js. The currently supported Node.js version is the latest LTS, v20.10.0. You can install it using nvm with 

[source,console]
----
nvm install --lts
nvm use --lts
----

=== Building

Take the following steps:

. Clone the source repository
. Change to the source directory. If you have already cloned the repository earlier, remember to pull the latest changes.
. Execute the following commands:

[source,console]
----
npm install
npm run build
npm install -g
----

=== Running

After building and installing, run `cyberismo --help` to see the command line help.
